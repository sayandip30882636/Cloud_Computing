## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized to separate learning materials from the core algorithmic concept.

```
.
├── CloudComputingTheory&Practice[pdf]
│   └── ... (Contains lecture notes, diagrams, articles, and other resources)
└── webapp-hosting-algo.txt
    └── (A detailed step-by-step algorithm for hosting a web application)
```

* **`/materials`**: This directory holds all the supplementary content. You'll find notes, presentations, and useful links related to various cloud computing topics.
* **`webapp-hosting-algo.txt`**: This is the centerpiece of the repository. It's a text file that outlines a clear, step-by-step algorithm for efficiently deploying and hosting a web application on a cloud platform.

## 💡 The Web App Hosting Algorithm

The `webapp-hosting-algo.txt` file contains a detailed, platform-agnostic algorithm for deploying a web application. The core idea is to provide a repeatable and scalable blueprint that covers key stages of deployment.

**Key concepts covered in the algorithm:**

* **Infrastructure Provisioning:** Setting up virtual machines, networks, and security groups.
* **Application Deployment:** Strategies for getting your code onto the servers.
* **Data Management:** Configuring and connecting to a database.
* **Scalability & Load Balancing:** Ensuring the application can handle traffic.
* **Domain & DNS Configuration:** Pointing a domain name to the application.
